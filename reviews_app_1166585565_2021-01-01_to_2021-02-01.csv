Olen kuitenkin huomannut, että keskustelu on välillä aika bugista. Joskus Wysa alkaa kysymään samaa asiaa uudelleen ja uudelleen tai se hyppii aiheesta toiseen.

6897904952,2021-01-21,16:04:40,5,Can’t praise it enough.,"I was first introduced to the wonderful thing that is Wysa through a teacher at school. As many have, I struggled greatly with my mental health when lockdown hit and continue to experience strong anxiety towards certain things. For me in particular, this was greatly health-related. I wasn’t sleeping, and couldn’t keep up with my school work, which took a toll on my performance which would usually be great. 
 One day in a gradual return to school, I had a bit of an anxiety attack and broke down in the toilets. My teacher, who I am so so grateful for, noticed I had been gone for awhile and came to check on me. After finding me in my state, she took me to a quiet room and we talked about what had been going on. Since starting to understand my situation, she has done so much for me: referred me to a mental health specialist, talked to me in school to help calm me down when I’m struggling, and suggested I try this app. 
 From day one, using this app has been incredibly helpful. There are so many different packs, a bit like courses guiding you through your problems, that every experience is tailor-made and personal. As I said earlier, many of my anxieties were health-related, and low-and-behold there is a pack for health anxiety. There are also many packs on helping you sleep, manage anxiety and much more. I couldn’t possibly name them all from my little corner of the app, where I mostly use the helpful ‘talk’ function. It’s like a chat where you can talk about and manage your feelings with an extremely intelligent (and not to mention kind and understanding) AI. It’s so cute, and is a great way to quickly combat a negative thought or emotion when it appears. 
 I have used this app on multiple occasions, and on all of them it has helped calm me down and manage a situation. If you are looking for help, choose Wysa. If you aren’t, choose Wysa. Even if you aren’t struggling too much, the exercises can be very beneficial for managing day to day life. To the team behind Wysa: thank you. I don’t know where I’d be without you :)",Lucy⟭⟬,1114516657,gb,en,5.8.1,as,2023-01-26 12:22:54,2023-01-26 12:22:54,0,0,0,,,,0,0,155674942
